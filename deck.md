- A Recommendation

- Retro / Action Items
- Questions

---

## Key Thesis

---

<br/>

### Ruby
is a multi-paradigm language

^ it is excellent with both object oriented programming and functional
programming. the developer gets to choose

---

<br/>
<br/>

```ruby
class A < B
Object.new
define_method(:foo)
```

<br/>

```ruby
-> (x) { |x| x + 1 }
data.map
yield_self / then
```

---

<br/>

### Different Paradigms
lend themselves to different tasks

^ some times we want to model some real world interactions, create things that
represent a useful thing. sometime we want take some information from point a to point b, sometimes we
want to ask some quantitative question of some data.

---

<br/>
<br/>

OO -> Behavior

<br/>

FP -> Data

---

<br/>

### We should choose
our programming style based off the task at hand

^ Doing so will lead to a better product.

^  Some automation tasks lend themselves to an object oriented solution, some to a
   functional solution.
  - Sometimes it makes sense to program ruby in an object oriented way
  - other times it makes sense to program ruby in a functional way.
  - It depends on the task.
  - (you may now leave)

---

<br/>
<br/>

If you are modeling *behavior*,
prefer *classes* and *composition*.

<br />

If you are handling *data*,
prefer data *pipelines* and *folds*.

---

## A Bit about FP and OO

---

<br/>

### Objects and Functions
are a useful distinction.

^ explain what you mean by fp
it's not a precise term, it means some different depending on who you're talking
to 
 functions are at the forefront
 avoiding mutation
 avoiding side effects

---

<br/>

### What is difficult to change
is perhaps a better distinction.

---

 `-` | Add new method | Add new Data
---|---|---
OO | Existing code unchanged | Existing code changed
FP | Existing code changed | Existing code unchanged

---

### OO Typical cases

- Resource modeling
- Behaviour modeling
- State modeling

---

### FP Typical cases

- Data transformations
- Data aggregates
- Data streaming
- Data templating

---

## A Recommendation

---

<br/>

### Given
that methods are easy to change in OO
and data are easy to change in FP

---

<br/>

### Ask
how you expect requirements
will change before beging a task.

^
  A good way to decide which task goes to which is by asking what is more
  likely to change in the future of your program, the behavior, or the data?
  thus given a task you're solving with programming, if you expect behavior to
  change, prefer object oriented. If you expect data to change, prefer functional programming

---

<br/>

### Base
this question off the context of your business
and what users might want

---

<br/>

## A Story
with some code

---

### Imagine a Rails App

^ explain the app: a generic rails product monolith, there are users, which have
things, and can do things, say a b to b of medium to largish size.

^ explain the problem: users would like to migrate to the app, they need to upload
their spreadsheets to the app, we need to ingest those spreadsheets, save the
rows for the users as active record objects. They'd like to upload the
spreadsheets to an ftp server and we'll poll it every day to import the files.

^ Lets call this product...

        Product.import(filepath)

        expect(Product.count).to eq 3
      end
    end
  end
```

---

### Initial Requirement
#### Gif

---

![](./images/upload_csv.mov)

---

### New Requirement (xlsx + csv)

---

1. Introduce product data importer

---

```ruby
class ProductDataImporter
  attr_reader :filepath

  def initialize(filepath)
    @filepath = filepath
  end

  def import
    CSV.foreach(filepath, headers: true) do |row|
      data = row.to_h
      data["active"] = data["active"] == "true"
      Product.create(data)
    end
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
class ImportsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    importer = ProductDataImporter.new(params[:file].path)
    importer.import
    redirect_to products_path, notice: "Succesfully imported"
  end
end
```

---

2. Introduce product data formatter

---

```ruby
class ProductDataFormatter
  def build(csv_row)
    data = csv_row.to_h.symbolize_keys
    data[:active] = data[:active] == "true"
    data[:release_date] = Time.zone.parse(data[:release_date])
    data[:value] = data[:value].to_i
    data
  end
end
```

---

3. Allow .xlsx format for importer

---

```ruby
require "csv"

class ProductDataImporter
  attr_reader :filepath, :formatter

  def initialize(filepath, formatter)
    @filepath = filepath
    @formatter = formatter
  end

  def import
    case File.extname(filepath)
    when ".csv"
      import_csv
    when ".xlsx"
      import_xlsx
    end
  end

  private

  def import_csv
    CSV.foreach(filepath, headers: true) do |row|
      formatted_data = formatter.build(row)
      formatted_data = formatter.build_csv(row)
      Product.create(formatted_data)
    end
  end

  def import_xlsx
    Xlsx.foreach(filepath) do |row|
      formatted_data = formatter.build_xlsx(row)
      Product.create(formatted_data)
    end
  end

...
end


```

---

### New Requirement
New client, new formats

---

1. refactor importer and raise if unknown file type

---

```ruby
require "csv"

class CsvImporter
  attr_reader :filepath, :formatter

  def initialize(filepath, formatter)
    @filepath = filepath
    @formatter = formatter
  end

  def import
    CSV.foreach(filepath, headers: true) do |row|
      formatted_data = formatter.build_csv(row)
      Product.create(formatted_data)
    end
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
class XlsxImporter
  attr_reader :filepath, :formatter

  def initialize(filepath, formatter)
    @filepath = filepath
    @formatter = formatter
  end

  def import
    Xlsx.foreach(filepath) do |row|
      formatted_data = formatter.build_xlsx(row)
      Product.create(formatted_data)
    end
  end
end
```

---

2. introduce file importer

---

```ruby
class FileImporter
  attr_reader :filepath, :formatter

  def initialize(filepath, formatter)
    @filepath = filepath
    @formatter = formatter
  end

  def import
    raise "Must overwrite method"
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
class XlsxImporter < FileImporter
  ...
end
```

```ruby
class CsvImporter < FileImporter
  ...
end
```

---

3. introduce data builder class

---

```ruby
class ProductDataBuilder
  attr_reader :formatter

  def initialize(formatter)
    @formatter = formatter
  end

  def build
    raise "Must override method"
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
class XlsxBuilder < ProductDataBuilder
  HEADERS = %w[name author release_date value version active].freeze

  def build(xlsx_row)
    cells = xlsx_row.cells.map(&:value)
    data = HEADERS.zip(cells).to_h.symbolize_keys
    formatter.format(data)
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
class CsvBuilder < ProductDataBuilder
  def build(csv_row)
    data = csv_row.to_h.symbolize_keys
    formatter.format(data)
  end
end
```

---

4. Strip $ from value attribute in formatter

---

```ruby
class ProductDataFormatter
  def format(data)
    data[:active] = data[:active] == "true"
    data[:release_date] = parse_release_date(data[:release_date])
    data[:value] = data[:value].to_i
    data[:value] = parse_value(data[:value])
    data
  end

  private

  def parse_release_date(input)
   ...
  end

  def parse_value(input)
    input.to_s.gsub(/^\$/, "").to_i
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
...
    context "when the value has a dollar sign" do
      it "strips the dollar sign" do
        formatter = ProductDataFormatter.new
        data = {
          name: "name",
          author: "author",
          version: "0.0.0",
          release_date: "20190101",
          value: "$1230",
          active: "true",
        }

        result = formatter.format(data)

        expect(result).to eq(
                    {
                      name: "name",
                      author: "author",
                      version: "0.0.0",
                      release_date: Time.zone.parse("20190101"),
                      value: 1230,
                      active: true,
                    },
                  )
      end
    end
```

---

### New Requirement (Data validation)

---

### Functional Path
Let's go back a few steps

---

### New Requirement (xlsx + csv)

---

1. Introduce product importer service

---

```ruby
require "csv"

class ProductDataImporter
  def self.import(filepath)
    new.import(filepath)
  end

  def import(filepath)
    CSV.foreach(filepath, headers: true) do |row|
      data = row.to_h
      data["active"] = data["active"] == "true"
      Product.create(data)
    end
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
RSpec.describe ProductDataImporter do
  describe ".import" do
    it "takes a file and creates product data from the data" do
      filename = Rails.root.join("spec/fixtures/products.csv")
      importer = ProductDataImporter.new

      importer.import(filename)

      expect(Product.count).to eq 3
      last_product = Product.last
      expect_product_to_match(
        last_product,
        "name_c",
        "author_c",
        Time.zone.parse("20190302"),
        3000,
        "0.53",
        true,
      )
    end
  end
```

---

2. Allow for users to upload either xlsx or csv

---

```ruby
require "csv"

class ProductDataImporter
  HEADERS = %w[name author release_date value version active].freeze

  def self.import(filepath)
    new.import(filepath)
  end

  def import(filepath)
    case File.extname(filepath)
    when ".csv"
      import_csv(filepath)
    when ".xlsx"
      import_xlsx(filepath)
    else
      raise "Unknown file type"
    end
  end

  private

  def import_csv(filepath)
    CSV.foreach(filepath, headers: true) do |row|
      data = row.to_h
      data["active"] = data["active"] == "true"
      data = row.to_h.symbolize_keys
      process_data(data)
    end
  end

  def import_xlsx(filepath)
    Xlsx.foreach(filepath) do |row|
      cells = row.cells.map(&:value)
      data = HEADERS.zip(cells).to_h.symbolize_keys
      process_data(data)
    end
  end

  def process_data(data)
    parse_active(data).
      then { |data| parse_release_date(data) }.
      then { |data| Product.create(data) }
    end
  end

  def parse_active(data)
    data[:active] = !!data[:active]
    data
  end

  def parse_release_date(data)
    data[:release_date] = Time.zone.parse(data[:release_date].to_i.to_s)
    data
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
  ...
    context "when provided a xlsx file" do
      it "creates product data from the data" do
        filename = Rails.root.join("spec/fixtures/products.xlsx")
        importer = ProductDataImporter.new

        importer.import(filename)

        expect(Product.count).to eq 4
        last_product = Product.last
        expect_product_to_match(
          last_product,
          "factory_bot",
          "thoughtbot",
          DateTime.new(2008, 5, 28),
          9001,
          "5.0.2",
          true,
        )
      end
```

---

### New Requirement (New client, new formats)

---

3. Strip $ from value attribute in import data

---

```ruby
class ProductDataImporter
 ...

 def process_data(data)
    parse_active(data).
      then { |data| parse_release_date(data) }.
      then { |data| parse_value(data) }.
      then { |data| Product.create(data) }
  end

...

  def parse_value(data)
    value = data[:value].to_s
    data[:value] = value.gsub(/^\$/, "").to_i
    data
  end
end
```

---

### Dev Time

OO - about a work day
FP - about an hour

---

### Take Away - Code Quality

---

## Benefits
of choosing the right paradigm for the task

- Less Code
- Easier to Test
- More Flexible
- More Honest

^ This is why your life may be better if you choose these approaches

---

## Paradigm Smells
Using OO for a task that lends itself to FP

- divergent changes / shotgun surgery
- lots of 'something-er' classes
- UML is a linked list

---

![50%, left](./images/03.png)

---

### Take Aways - Process

---

<br/>

### It's Useful
to consider the what about the task you expect to change

---

<br/>

### Sprinkles,
just a little goes a long way

^ The majority of what we want to do in our Rails apps is concerned with
behavior, so we would expect that most of our applicaiton code will be classes
and object, thats our models, sevice objects, controllers, but sometimes we have
other task that needs to be done which would lend themselves to a funcitonal
style, but it would be a mistake to try to do everything in a functional style.

---

<br/>

### Be Conscientious
of buisness goals before starting work.

^ It's only helpful to pick one paradigm over the other when we know something is
is likely to change and in what way it will change. If you're not considering
the bigger picture, you're at risk of choosing poorly.

---

## Action Items

1. Understand your task before you choose style
2. Ask what do you expect will change?
3. Data or Behaviour?
4. if Data, consider a functional style
5. if Behaviour, consider a object oriented style

---

## Thesis

- Given Ruby is a general purpose language.
- And different paradigms lend themselves to different tasks
- We should choose our style based off of our task
