<h2>
  Take Aways / Key Thesis
</h2>

<h3>Ruby</h3>
<div>is a general purpose language.</div>

<Notes> it is excellent with both object oriented programming and functional progamming
</Notes>

<Notes> the developer gets to choose</Notes>

---

<Horizontal>

```
Object.new
```

```
l = -> x { x + 1 }

```
</Horizontal>

<h3>Different Paradigms</h3>
<div>lend themselves to different tasks</div>

<Notes>
some times we want to model some real world interactions, create things that
represent a useful thing.

sometime we want take some information from point a to point b, sometimes we
want to ask some quantitative question of some data.

</Notes>

---

<Horizontal>
<h3>OO -> Behaviour</h3>
<h3>FP -> Data</h3>
</Horizontal>

---

<h3>We should choose</h3>
<div>our progamming style based off the task at hand</div>

<Notes>
   Some automation tasks lend themselves to an object oriented solution, some to a
   functional solution.
  - Sometimes it makes sense to program ruby in an object oriented way
  - other times it makes sense to program ruby in a functional way.
  - It depends on the task.

<h2>Behaviour and Data</h2>
<div>is the distinction</div>

<Notes>
explain what you mean by fp
it's not a percise term, it means some different depending on who you're talking
to 
- functions are at the forfront
- avoiding mutation
- avoiding side effects

<h3>Ask</h3>
<small>What do you expect will change</small>

<Notes>
  A good way to decide which task goes to which is by asking what is more
  likely to change in the future of your program, the behaviour, or the data?
  thus given a task you're solving with programming, if you expect behaviour to
  change, prefer object oriented. if you expect data to change, prefer functional programming

<h2>Illustration</h2>

---

<p>Imagine a Rails App</p>

<Notes>
explain the app: a generic rails product monolith, there are users, which have
things, and can do things, say a b to b of medium to largish size.

explain the problem: users would like to migrate to the app, they need to upload
their spreadsheets to the app, we need to ingest those spreadsheets, save the
rows for the users as active record objects. They'd like to upload the
spreadsheets to an ftp server and we'll poll it every day to import the files.

Lets call this product...
</Notes>

---

<h3>Inital Requirement</h3>

<Notes>
1. rake task to poll the data - iterate over the files in the ftp server, kick
   off background worker
2. worker: call importer class - iterate over the rows, save to the database
3. success
</Notes>

<h4>New Requirement: .xlsx + .csv</h4>

Add dimension: Excel + CSV
new requirements from the sales team. they want csv and excel (and they
apparently can't just export excel to csv)

<h3>Sprinkles</h3>
<div>
just a little goes a long way
</div>

<Notes>
The majority of what we want to do in our Rails apps is concerned with
behaviour, so we would expect that most of our applicaiton code will be classes
and object, thats our models, sevice objects, controllers, but sometimes we have
supporting work that needs to be done and sometimes those tasks would be better
served with a functional approach
